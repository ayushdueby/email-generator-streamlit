Dear Hiring Manager,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am reaching out to express my interest in Software Development Engineer roles in core development. My background combines hands-on software engineering experience in fintech, scalable full-stack product development, and academic research.

During my time at FNZ, I contributed to enterprise-grade onboarding systems and financial wizards used by clients across APAC and UK. My work on over 100 API integrations and reusable backend workflows helped reduce onboarding effort by 70% through automation. I also contributed to Curtis Bank’s AI workflow enhancements using rule chaining to improve logical flow and cut manual intervention by 30%.

In addition, I built Kraft AI — a SaaS platform enabling real-time content generation using Google Gemini LLMs. It features secure authentication, dynamic billing with Stripe, and modular content tools (blogs, code, social media captions) powered by a Next.js + MongoDB stack.

Key Achievements:
- Best Employee Award recipient for technical impact and teamwork.
- Solved 1000+ DSA problems across leading platforms.
- Mentored 300+ students in C++ and Data Structures through live sessions and 1:1 guidance.
- Finalist in ISRO’s Space Kidz Challenge for building a real-time rover dashboard.
- National-level RoboCup Jr. finalist, felicitated by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.
- Co-author of a Springer LNNS (Scopus-indexed) research paper on Parkinson’s detection using speech signals.

I am proficient in C++, Node.js, React, REST APIs, and SQL, with a strong understanding of SDLC, OOP, and scalable system design. I am passionate about building clean, efficient, and user-centric software, and I thrive in fast-paced, engineering-driven environments.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your development team and am open to both internship and full-time SDE opportunities.

Best regards,
