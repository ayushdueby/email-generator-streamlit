Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Development Engineer role at your organization. With hands-on experience in building scalable backends, latency-optimized real-time systems, and production-grade fintech workflows, I bring the technical depth and execution needed for fast-moving engineering teams.

In my current role at FNZ Group (FinTech), I contribute to APAC and UK onboarding pipelines, where I:

Automated 70% of client onboarding using 100+ REST/SOAP API integrations, reducing latency by 25% and defects by 35%

Delivered 30+ production workflows powering KYC, account creation, and financial rule validation

Integrated AI-driven rule generation to reduce configuration effort by 30%

Improved system throughput by optimizing DB queries, caching layers, and workflow orchestration under load

Beyond FNZ, I’ve built multiple full-stack platforms that demonstrate my ability to design scalable architectures end-to-end:

Bidly — Real-Time Service Bidding Platform

A production-ready service marketplace built with Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Redis, and Socket.IO, featuring role-based dashboards, secure JWT routes, and real-time bid streams using Redis Pub/Sub.
Achieved sub-800 ms event latency and reduced DB read load by 40% via indexed queries, bid snapshots, and server-side caching.

SwipeHire — Skills-Based Job Matching Platform

A Tinder-style recruiting system with swipes, real-time matching, and secure chat.
Engineered a high-performance matching engine using MongoDB compound indexes and Redis sorted sets, reducing match detection to <50 ms.
Implemented role-based access control, authenticated routes, and scalable APIs designed for ML-driven ranking.

Coding Ninjas — Code Solutions Assistant

Mentored 300+ learners in C++/DSA debugging with a 4.7/5 rating and resolved 1,000+ technical queries involving memory issues, algorithmic inefficiencies, and optimizations.

I have strong expertise in:

C++, Node.js, React, TypeScript, MongoDB, Redis, Socket.IO

REST API design, workflow automation, concurrency optimization

LLM integration, caching strategies, real-time architectures

I thrive in engineering-driven teams and enjoy designing systems that are not only functional but fast, reliable, and scalable. I am confident that my experience in fintech automation, backend engineering, real-time systems, and end-to-end product development will allow me to contribute effectively from day one.
