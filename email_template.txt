Hi,

I am a Software Developer with hands-on experience in building high-performance backend systems using Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, and real-time architectures. I currently work in a FinTech environment where I design and optimize low-latency REST and WebSocket APIs, integrate distributed services, and work on production systems serving large-scale transaction workflows.

My background includes:

* Building concurrent, multithreaded systems (matching engines, real-time streaming, in-memory processing)
* Developing scalable Spring Boot microservices with JPA, Hibernate, Redis, MongoDB, and SQL
* Designing clean, versioned, idempotent APIs and performance-critical components
* Integrating AI capabilities (Spring AI, LLMs, embeddings, vector search) into backend platforms

I have worked on systems handling 100K+ users, optimized API latency to sub-150ms, and built a full low-latency stock exchange matching engine supporting 10K+ orders/sec with price-time priority and real-time order book streaming.

I am actively seeking challenging backend engineering roles where system design, performance, and reliability truly matter. I would welcome the opportunity to explore how my experience can contribute to building scalable, mission-critical platforms.
