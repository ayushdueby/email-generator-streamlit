Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Software Development Engineer role. 

I have 8 months of experience at FNZ Group (FinTech), where I automated 70% of client onboarding using 100+ REST/SOAP APIs, reduced latency by 25%, delivered 30+ financial workflows, and integrated AI-driven rule generation that cut manual effort by 30%.

I’ve built scalable real-time systems such as:

Bidly: real-time bidding platform (Next.js, Node.js, Redis, Socket.IO) with sub-800 ms events and 40% reduced DB load.

SwipeHire: job-matching platform with <50 ms match detection using MongoDB compound indexes and Redis.

I also mentored 300+ students (C++/DSA) with a 4.7/5 rating during my Coding Ninjas role.

My strengths include backend development, API design, real-time systems, caching, and scalable architectures across Node.js, React, TypeScript, MongoDB, Redis, and WebSockets.

I am confident I can contribute quickly to your engineering team.
