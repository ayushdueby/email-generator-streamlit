Dear Hiring Manager,
I hope you’re doing well.

I am writing to express my interest in core Software Development Engineer positions at your organization. I bring hands‑on experience building high‑impact fintech solutions, scalable full‑stack products, and academic research achievements.

Tech Stack: C++, Node.js, Next.js, React, TypeScript, MongoDB, Socket.IO, RESTful APIs, OAuth2/JWT, SQL, Real‑Time Systems, LLM Integration, Redis

Professional Experience & Impact

FNZ (Fintech Onboarding Systems): Contributed to enterprise‑grade client onboarding portals and “financial wizards” across APAC and the UK. Delivered over 100 API integrations and reusable backend workflows that reduced onboarding effort by 70% through end‑to‑end automation.

Curtis Bank (AI Workflow Enhancements): Implemented rule‑chaining logic to streamline AI‑driven workflows, cutting manual intervention by 30% and improving reliability in customer service processes.

Key Project – Bidly: Real‑Time Bidding Platform

Developed a full‑stack Next.js + Node.js application with role‑based dashboards for service providers and consumers.

Authentication & Security: Integrated Clerk (OAuth2) with JWT tokens in HTTP‑only cookies to secure all routes and prevent session hijacking.

High‑Performance APIs: Built 8+ RESTful endpoints for service posting, bidding, profile management, and offer acceptance—achieving <200 ms average response times under load.

Real‑Time Infrastructure: Engineered Socket.IO–based event streams for live job posts, bids, and acceptances with <1 s end‑to‑end latency.

DB Optimization: Designed MongoDB schemas with TTL indexing to auto‑purge expired services and stale bids (after 7 days), improving query speed by ~35%.

1:1 Chat: Laid the foundation for direct consumer‑provider messaging using socket rooms and event‑driven architecture.

LLM Integration (Planned): Preparing to integrate OpenAI/Gemini for natural‑language service search (e.g., “Find a plumber near me this weekend”) and provider ranking.

Select Achievements

Best Employee Award at FNZ for technical excellence and collaboration.

Solved 1,000+ DSA problems on leading platforms.

Mentored 300+ students in C++ and data structures via live workshops and one‑on‑one coaching.

National‑level RoboCup Jr. finalist, felicitated by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.

Co‑author of a Springer LNNS (Scopus‑indexed) paper on Parkinson’s detection using speech signals.

I’m proficient in C++, Node.js, React, REST API design, and SQL, with a strong grasp of SDLC, OOP principles, and scalable system design. I thrive in fast‑paced, engineering‑driven teams and am eager to contribute my skills to your next innovative project.

Thank you for considering my application. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can drive impact as part of your SDE team.
