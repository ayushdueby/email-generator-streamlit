Dear Hiring Manager,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am reaching out to express my interest in Software Development Engineer roles in core development. My background combines hands-on software engineering experience in fintech, scalable full-stack product development, and academic research.

During my time at FNZ, I contributed to enterprise-grade onboarding systems and financial wizards used by clients across APAC and UK. My work on over 100 API integrations and reusable backend workflows helped reduce onboarding effort by 70% through automation. I also contributed to Curtis Bank’s AI workflow enhancements using rule chaining to improve logical flow and cut manual intervention by 30%.

Developed a full-stack bidding platform with role-based dashboards used by 30+ test users to post jobs and receive live bids from nearby service providers.
● Integrated Clerk (OAuth2) for secure authentication with JWT-based session tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies, enabling 100% protected route access and preventing session hijacking.
● Built 8+ RESTful API endpoints for posting services, placing/updating bids, user profile management, and accepting offers, achieving <200ms API response time in load tests.
● Engineered real-time infrastructure with Socket.IO, allowing instant updates across roles for new job posts, live bidding, and bid acceptances with <1s latency.
● Designed and optimized MongoDB schemas with TTL indexing, enabling automatic deletion of expired services and stale bids (after 7 days), improving DB query speed by ~35%.
● Implemented foundational 1:1 real-time chat with socket rooms and event-driven architecture, enabling direct consumer-provider messaging.
● (Planned) Integrating LLM-based service filtering with OpenAI/Gemini to support natural language queries (e.g., “Find a plumber near me this weekend”) and rating-based provider ranking.

Key Achievements:
- Best Employee Award recipient for technical impact and teamwork.
- Solved 1000+ DSA problems across leading platforms.
- Mentored 300+ students in C++ and Data Structures through live sessions and 1:1 guidance.
- Finalist in ISRO’s Space Kidz Challenge for building a real-time rover dashboard.
- National-level RoboCup Jr. finalist, felicitated by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.
- Co-author of a Springer LNNS (Scopus-indexed) research paper on Parkinson’s detection using speech signals.

I am proficient in C++, Node.js, React, REST APIs, and SQL, with a strong understanding of SDLC, OOP, and scalable system design. I am passionate about building clean, efficient, and user-centric software, and I thrive in fast-paced, engineering-driven environments.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your development team and am open to both internship and full-time SDE opportunities.

Best regards,
